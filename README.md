# Netflix Dataset - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis and preprocessing steps performed on the **Netflix dataset** using **Jupyter Notebook**. The dataset includes information about Netflix movies, shows, ratings, genres, and other features, and this project focuses on cleaning the dataset and transforming it into a usable format for further analysis or machine learning applications.

Required libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- 
## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### 1. **Handling Missing Values**
In this step, missing values in important columns were identified and handled appropriately, using methods like imputation or removal, depending on the context.

### 2. **Formatting and Standardizing Columns**
Columns such as **release year**, **duration**, and **ratings** were standardized into consistent formats, including:
- Converting release year to numeric values.
- Standardizing duration to a uniform unit (e.g., minutes).
- Ensuring ratings were numerical.

### 3. **Handling Duplicate Entries**
Identifying and removing any duplicate entries in the dataset to ensure data integrity.

### 4. **Converting Data Types**
Ensuring that the correct data types (e.g., strings, integers, dates) were used for each column, optimizing the dataset for analysis.

### 5. **Feature Engineering (Optional)**
Additional features or columns may have been created, such as extracting the **year** from the release date or **decoding** categorical variables into usable formats.

### 6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Optional)**
Basic exploratory analysis to understand distributions, detect outliers, and prepare for deeper analysis, such as identifying the most common genres or content types.

## Conclusion

The final cleaned dataset can now be used for various purposes such as:
- Data analysis and insights extraction.
- Predictive modeling and machine learning applications.
- Visualizations to explore content trends over time.
